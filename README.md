# Peter Dravecky - Assignment - s5305642
A OpenGL renderer with the following features (in order of implementation):

- Able to load objects and move them around the scene
    - create a way to load objects that aren't purely made of triangles
    - create a structure for managing selection of objects and loading textures
    - Create a Qt layout which allows selection of objects and changing of their properties

- Create support for each object having their own textures using PBR shading
    - should~ be fairly straightforward

- Lights -  directional, multiple point lights
- Shadow-Mapping
    - Forward Renderer

Stretch Goals:
 - Global Illumination
